#Breaking Bad Generator

* The journey
    - Used Jquery before in the application but
        > Solved using plain JS code since it is a small application
    - Had ES6 support problems, 
        > so changed to ES5 code and applied polyfills for few
    - Had external smoke emitter js file for emitting smoke from RV 
    - Used standalone jasmine unit testing 
        > Then changed to use Karma for running Jasmine unit test cases
    - Used Gulp to watch all file changes and build
    - While building i need to inject JS and CSS files directly into html instead of manual configuration
        > So Webpack came to rescue.
